## Security Improvements
To improve my online security I have kaspersky installed and configure the safe money tool of the application for my online financial accounts. Also, I previously used to use the same password for a lot of accounts even bank accounts,but now I am implementing encryption using a password manager. I also figured to connect to GitHub with SSH key. My firwale is now very strong and I am not allowing anknown applications to connect to my machine. I also use to step authentication in email accounts.
